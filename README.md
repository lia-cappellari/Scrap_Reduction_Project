# Scrap_Reduction_Project
Employed R and SQL to analyze data and identify areas for improvement in material handling processes, resulting in a targeted 10% reduction in scrap and an annual cost savings of $700,000

## Abstract 
This report presents a comprehensive solution to address Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s significant scrap costs associated with their diverse stock keeping units (SKUs). The project aims to lower Thermo's annual scrap costs valued at tens of millions of dollars through effective scrap management strategies. Initial approaches involve identifying SKUs with high scrap value and quantity, analyzing their usage patterns, and exploring variable influences. To streamline the complexity of scrap management, a final strategy utilizing K-Means clustering is proposed. This technique groups SKUs based on shared characteristics to identify clusters with similar scrap quantities, while outliers are determined using statistical methods. A prioritization approach is employed, creating a table of top outlier SKUs with high opportunities for scrap reduction. Financial opportunity, calculated by multiplying unit cost value by the delta (the difference between outlier and non-outlier scrap quantities), quantifies potential savings. A conservative approach is adopted to address skewed distributions and reduce the impact of outliers on Thermo Fisher. The report suggests a future tool for automated screening, allowing dynamic cluster creation and customization options. This tool aims to save time and resources by replacing manual clustering methods. Insights into potential savings through various percentages of scrap reduction within the top 10 outlying SKUs in each cluster are provided. For instance, a 15% reduction in scrap for these SKUs would save Thermo Fisher $1.1 million.
